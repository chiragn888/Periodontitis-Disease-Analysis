Based on the context provided, there appears to be a missing "source" tag in the JSON structure. However, no explicit information about "XGB.ipynb" is provided in the given context.

Assuming that you want to utilize XGBoost (a powerful gradient boosting framework) in your code, an example code snippet could look like this:

```
from xgboost import XGBClassifier

X_train,X_test,y_train,y_test=train_test_split(df,df['target'],train_size=0.8)

xgb = XGBClassifier(use_label_encoder =False)
xgb.fit(X_train,y_train)

y_pred = xgb.predict(X_test)

print("Accuracy score of the model is:",accuracy_score(y_test,y_pred)*100,"%")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

In this code, X_train and y_train are input features and target feature of the training dataset respectively, while X_test and y_test are the input features and target feature of the test dataset. Please replace 'df', 'X_train' etc. with your actual data frame and series names as they are in your project. The target needs to be replaced by the actual target column in your dataset.

The model is trained using the `fit` function and performance is evaluated using `accuracy_score` and `classification_report`. Make sure to import these functions:

```
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
```

This should solve your issue. If you could provide a more specific error message or detailing about your problem related to "XGB.ipynb", it would be easier to provide a more targeted solution.
