From the context provided, it's hard to tell exactly where the syntax error is occurring in the XGB.ipynb because the XGB code snippet is not provided in the context. However, I can provide you with a basic XGB (XGBoost) implementation code snippet:

```
from xgboost import XGBClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# split data into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(df, target, train_size=0.8, stratify=target)

# fit model on training data
model = XGBClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# make predictions for test data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# evaluate predictions
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Accuracy: %.2f%%" % (accuracy * 100.0))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```
This is a basic implementation of XGBoost for classification problem. It's a step-by-step procedure where it first imports necessary libraries and XGBClassifier from xgboost. Then it splits the data into training and testing parts. Then we fit the model on the training data and make predictions on test data. Finally, it evaluates the predictions by calculating the accuracy and displaying the classification report.

Keep in mind that you should replace 'df' and 'target' with your actual dataframe and target variable. Remember to ensure that 'xgboost' library is installed. If not, you can install it using pip:

```
!pip install xgboost
```
